\description{
Append fluorescence data from a SAGA file to an AFLP object.
}
\usage{
readSAGA(filename, add.to, caseSensitive = TRUE, maxMissing = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
  \item{filename}{
	The SAGA file to be imported.
}
  \item{add.to}{
	The AFLP object were the fluorescence is appended to.
}
  \item{caseSensitive}{
	Use case sensitivity on the labels of the replicates. Defaults to TRUE.
}
  \item{maxMissing}{
	A relative threshold. If more than this ratio of replicates have missing data, then
	no data is appended.
}
}
\value{
	Return an AFLP object. If add.to is an AFLP object, then the fluorescence data
	is appended to it. Otherwise a new AFLP object is created.
