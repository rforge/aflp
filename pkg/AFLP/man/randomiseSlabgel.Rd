\title{Randomise specimens over different slab gels.}
\usage{
  randomiseSlabgel(Specimens, Group = NULL,
    nReplicates = 3, nQC = 0, nLanes = 64)
}
\arguments{
  \item{Specimens}{Either the number of specimens or a
  vector with the names of the specimens.}

  \item{Group}{A vector indication the a priori clustering
  of specimens. Must be as long as the number of specimens
  and in the same order. When missing, no a priori
  clustering is assumed. Defaults to NULL.}

  \item{nReplicates}{The minimum number specimens that will
  be replicated on the same gel.}

  \item{nQC}{The number of quality control specimens. They
  are appended to the Specimens. There position is fixed at
  the last positions of each plate.}

  \item{nLanes}{The number of lanes on a plate.}
}
\value{
  Results in an AFLP object with randomised replicates.
}
\description{
  This function randomises Specimens over the required
  number of plates depending on the size of the plates, the
  minimum number of replicated specimens per plate and the
  number of quality control specimens per plate.
}
\details{
  The function ensures that at least \code{nReplicates}
  replications within each plate. These specimens are also
  replicated on one of the other plates. This has two
  advantages. First it helps to quantify the plate effect
  in the normalisation. Second it generates the replication
  needed to evaluate the repeatability.

  Any left-over lanes on a plate are filled with additional
  replications of specimens which have yet been replicated.
