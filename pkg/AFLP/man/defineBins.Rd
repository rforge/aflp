\title{
Define bins in AFLP object
}
\description{
This function is only relevant when the AFLP object contains raw data of peak values. 

The peaks are aggregated into bins according to the algoritme described by Arrigo et al (2009) 
\cite{Arrigo2009}.
}
\usage{
defineBins(dataset, minPeakHeight, minBinWidth = 1, 
  maxBinWidth = 5, missingPeakRatio = 0.8)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dataset}{
	An AFLP object
}
  \item{minPeakHeight}{
	If set, only peaks with at least this amount of RFU will be taken into account when defining 
	bins.
}
  \item{minBinWidth}{
	Bins wider that this minimum AND who have at least one replicate with more than one peak in
	that bin, will be split into to smaller bins.
}
  \item{maxBinWidth}{
	If a bin is wider than this number of basepairs, then the algorithm will split the bin, 
	regardless the number of peaks within each replicate.
}
  \item{missingPeakRatio}{
	If no peak is found for a give bin and given replicate, then a peak value will be given that 
	is equal to mssingPeakRatio times the lowest peak value in the dataset.
}
}
\value{
	A new AFLP object were the fluorescence slot is replaced by the bins.
